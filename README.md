# Machine Learning and MLP for EEG-Analysis
The code in this repo is part of a larger project for EEG signal analysis for the course of Advanced Techniques of Signal Processing.

We were a team of 5 and I was the person responsible for the development of ML and MLP algorithms. 

Please consider that this is an ongoing project with the goal of publishing a paper in 2025, hence both of the algorithms are not at their final state.
